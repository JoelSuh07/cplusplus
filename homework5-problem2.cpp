 *      An online retailer sells five products whose retail prices are as follows:
 *      Product 1, $2.98;
 *      product 2, $4.50;
 *      product 3, $9.98;
 *      product 4, $4.49 and
 *      product 5, $6.87.
 *      Write an application that reads a series of pairs of numbers as follows:
 *      product number
 *      quantity sold
 *
		Your program should use a switch statement to determine the retail price for each product.
		It should calculate and display the total retail value of all products sold.
		Use a sentinel-controlled loop to determine when the program should stop looping and display the final results.
